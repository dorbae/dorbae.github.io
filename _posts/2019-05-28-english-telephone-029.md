## Part 3
* Question
    * Which is better do it yourself present or present bought in a shop?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think buying present is better than making it byself. Because it is common belief that making byself is more effort and precious for someone who receive it. But, I think if I buy some present for someone, I can give more good product for him or her.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think buying some items to be given as presents is much better especially for modern people who are usually busy. In addition, I noticed based from the people around me that many prefer items bought from some shops because they are usually more pricey and durable.

    > product -> item

<br />

* Question
    * Who do you think is better at making gift men or women?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think women are better in making the present. Because I think women are usually better at making foods and clothes and other items. Because they have more hand-skill than men. And they are more meticulous than men.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think women are more creative and meticulous so they could be better at making gifts. While men, on the other hand are more impatient so they couldn't probably stand spending so much time making some presents. 

    > meticulous : 꼼꼼한

<br />

* Question
    * Is it popular to give hand-made gift in your country?

* Answer (In my case)
    * Yes, I think it is very popular in my country. So, some people make a cake or neck warmer for birthday of their friends or family. In my case, I also made chocolate by hand-made for my wife. And chocolate stick is very common and popular hand-made gift in my country. 

<br />

* Question
    * Do you think expensive gifts are always more valuable than cheap ones?

* Answer (In my case)
    * When I was young, I thought the price of present was not important and effort was more precious. But, nowadays, pricey present is better than others such as hand-made present. Above all, I think the best present is which receiver wants to buy.

    > I think the value of a gift doesn't depent on its price, instead it depends on the the giver's sincerity.

    > when kids make a very simple gift for their parents, parents are usually very touched and thrilled
