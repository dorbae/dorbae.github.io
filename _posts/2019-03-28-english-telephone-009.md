# 전화영어 - Day 009 (20190328)

## Part 3

* Question
    * What subjects are more practical to learn nowadays?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think English is one of the most practical subjects because it is used all over the world . so if we can speak English well we can learn more other things easily because we can communicate with other nationalities. Therefore, I think English is very important subject to us. 

<br />

* Question
    * Do you think all teacher should have entertaining teaching styles?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think being entertaining is a useful skill because I think it can motivate students and make them more interested in the class. If the teacher is too strict or too boring student might lose their interest in the class.

<br />

* Question
    * Do you think learning many subjects at one time is better or learning just one subject is better? 

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think learning one subject is better for students than learning many subjects at once. This is because if we learn too many subject at the same time we may not be able to memorize or remember that things that we are learning. Of course learning a lot of things is useful, but learning something deeply is more important. For instance, if we study math harder and more deeply we can study science more easily because science is related with math. 

## Part 1

* Question
    * Were you patient when you were young?

<br />

* Question
    * How do you feel when other people are impatient?

* Answer (Correction)
    * If someone around me is impatient I usually feel bad because I think he could affect the others around him. For instance, I experienced working in a group where one of the members gave up, as a result our presentation got spoiled. 

<br />

* Question
    * Will you less patient or more patient when you were angry?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I don't think I am, usually when I am angry, it is hard for me to control my emotions. For example, when me and my friends were playing basket against another team, an opponent hit my friend. We got angry and we started argue with the other team. As a result we lost the game because we used our emotions instead of being patient.
