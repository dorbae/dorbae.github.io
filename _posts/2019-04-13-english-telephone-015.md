# 전화영어 - Day 015 (20190413)


## Part 3

* Question
    * Do you think is it easy to become handsome or beautiful?

* Answer (My case)
    * No, I don't think so. Becoming handsome or beautiful is very difficult. The reason is because to be handsome or beautiful, people should exercise everyday, spend a lot of money to make skin smooth and clear. To maintain their good shape, they should eat a little and they can only eat fresh food. In our country, there are lots of people who do lots of plastic surgery to be more beautiful so I think it is very difficult to be handsome or beautiful.

* Answer (Teacher)
    * No, I don't think so. A lot of people think that due of the advent of cosmetic surgery, it is easy for people to be beautiful but I think it is the other way around because not only it is expensive, but it is also painful and dangerous. In addition, to be good-looking, people have to exert so much effort. For instance, they must work out regularly despite their busy schedule, and they should also refrain from eating the food they love instead they should eat healthy but sometimes bland food. So I think it isn't easy to be beautiful or handsome.

<br />

* Question
    * What are the disadvantages of being good looking?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think there are several disadvantages of being beautiful or handsome. First, their true ability and skill may not be recognized by others and they might thing that their success or achievement is only because of their physical appearance. 
    
    * they can always be the subject of others jealousy and enviousness, so some people will always hate no matter what they do

    * wether they like it or not, they may always easily catch others attention so they may sometimes feel their privacy is being violated

> I think main one is ... 이런 식으로 답변해서 하나만 말하기

<br />

* Question
    * In your country, what do people think beauty?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Most people in my country used to think that beauty is important in our lives because it helps us achieve success and things that we want to get. So many people used to spend money to be more handsome or beautiful. For instance, they work out reglarly and buy cosmetic goods. But nowadays some people realize that beauty is not the most important thing in our lives and spending time too much time on beauty is not useful to us. Instead, our ability and personality are the most important factors to help us succeed.

## Part 1

* Question
    * How long can you remember your dream when you wake up?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I usually do not remember most of my dreams upon waking up except my dream is something scary or weird.

<br />

* Question
    * Have you had a bad dream or nightmare before?

* Answer
    * Yes, I have. In fact, I had several nightmares already. Once I dreamed of falling off a building and a mountain. I also once dreamed of being killed by someone.

> nightmare dream(X) -> nightmare(O)

<br />

* Question
    * Do you like listening to the other's dreams?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, I do especially beacause people have various kinds of dreams which are usually interesting. By listening to their dreams I could feel entertained and could imagine them.

    * I can feel their emotion such as scared, happy and weird

<br />

* Question
    * Do you dream will affect our real lives?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Personally, I think it does because in my case when I had a bad dream I usually couldn't get it off my mind and it affects my concentration at work. On the other hand, if I had a good dream, I feel happy and light the whole day.

<br />

* Question
    * Do you believe in superstitions related to dreams?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, I do. In my country we believe that seeing a pig or our ancestors in our dream symbolizes luck, so I usually buy lottery tickets whenever I dream about them.

> superstitions : 미신
