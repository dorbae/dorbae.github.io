* Question
    * Describe a time you enjoyed your free time
    * You should say: 
        * When it was
        * Where you were
        * What you did
        * And how you felt about it

* Answer (Correction)
    * Last year, I got married so was entitled for a long vacation for honeymoon. I took this opportunity to also be free from anything related to my work. We went to Cancun, Mexico where we enjoyed our stay in a hotel with a lot of amenities. We also enjoyed the beautiful beach of Mexico and visited their pyrmids. After then, we also went to New York City where we enjoyed a lot of food and drinks. We even visited a brewery where we learned about beer-making and drank fresh beer. We also attended an interactive musical play which was very fun and exciting. This experience is very unforgettable and it made me relieve my stress. I was also glad to spend a lot of free time with my wife.

## Part 3
* Question
    * What do people in your country normally do when they are free?

* Answer (In my case)
    * In my country, many peole are in their home or go out for taking break. Someone of them usually meet up their friends and go to movie theater or go to cafe for taking about their lives and work. And some of them prefer to spend their time at home. Because they sometimes have stress from other people. They watch TV or play video games at home.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Some people prefer to just stay at home and spend their time either with their family or alone. They usually watch tv, read books, listen to music and so on. ON the other hand, there are those people who are likely to spend time outdoors with their friends. They enjoy their time together by talking in a cafe over a cup of  coffee, play some outdoor sports, watch a movie and more.

* Question
    * Do you think most people nowaday are able to manage their free time?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I don't think so. It is because nowdays many people are so busy in their working. And also they have a lot of thinks they have to do. So, in fact, they have no freetime. Even though some people have to work on weekend. However in Korea, for this year employees have to work less than 52 hours a week. So after that, many people have free time.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I don't think so because many people nowadays, can't even find free time. Many modern people are busy working and there many things they have to accomplish. Nevertheless, I believe that, despite their busy life if they are good at time management, they can always find some free time.

* Question
    * Do you think parents should make plans for their children?

* Answer (Homework)
    * No I don't. It is very easy for parents to make plans for their children. However, I think it is very harmful to their children. The reason I think it is that it can make them as parent-dependent. Also, plans that they can't do make them disappointed and exhausted. They should build plans they can do and want to do themselves. Futhermore, they already know what they have to do and how they do. Therfore, it is more efficient for childrent to build plans themsevles. And whenever they finish their plan, they feel proud of themsevles.
