## Part 1

* Answer (In my case)

## Part 2
* Question
    * Describe a newly built public facility (such as parks, cinemas, etc.) that influences your city
    * You should say: 
        * Where this facility is
        * When it was built
        * What people can do there
        * What influence this facility has

* Answer (In my case)
    * I'd like to talk about the park in my city. Many people called it as Yeonam-Park. Because it is in Yeonam-dong. In the past, there was train track which was not used for a long time. And three years ago, the goverment rebuilt the park in there. Nowadays, many people take a rest in there drinking beer, playing music, just talking with their friends. After rebuiling the park, many people can relieve their stress taking a break. And also there are many stores such as food restaraunts, accessory shops. Because due to new park, many people go there.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to talk about the park in my city.

So this park provided people with a place where they can relieve their stress, bond with their friends and spend quality time with their family. Around the park, there are some some stores such as restaurants, convenience stores, boutiques and more which means this park also allowed people to start their own business and help those who are unemployed. So I think this park has a lot of influences to the people and our society.

## Part 3
* Question
    * What measures should be taken to deal with damage on public facilities?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think if someone damages public facilities, administrator of them or the goverment should take fine about that to him or her. And, the goverment should think about preventing the damages. For example, they should warn to people by setting up warning sign in there.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think the administrator of those public facilities should impose the rules and regulations strictly. For example, those offenders should pay some fine or even go to jail. It would also be helpful to set up some warning signs and CCTV cameras to prevent people from damaging public facilities.

    > impose : 재정하다, 부과하다

<br />

* Question
    * What are the differences between old facilities and new facilities?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think there are many differences between old ones and new ones. At first, the old facilities have long history of them. Many feel comportable in there, becuase they are very familiar with many people. On the other hand, the new facilities provide more thinks for people. And there are more facilities in there such as toilets and the places for baby. For example, the new shopping complex usually has the place where babies can play and from it many parents can take a shopping freely. Also there are leisure facilities in there such as cinema, boutique, electronic shop, so on.

* Answer (Correction)
    * First, old facilities usually have long history so people feel more comfortable when visiting them since they have become very familiar to them. On the other, new facilities offer much more convenience to people because they have a lot of new places, activities and more to offer. For example, they have feeding stations for moms and their babies however, old facilities do not. In addition, new shopping malls have more shops to choose from including international ones, but old shopping malls usually have local stores.

    > convenience : 컨**베**니언스(x) 컨**비**니언스(o)
    

<br />

* Question
    * Is it popular to give hand-made gift in your country?

* Answer (In my case)
    * Yes, I think it is very popular in my country. So, some people make a cake or neck warmer for birthday of their friends or family. In my case, I also made chocolate by hand-made for my wife. And chocolate stick is very common and popular hand-made gift in my country. 

<br />

* Question
    * Do you think expensive gifts are always more valuable than cheap ones?

* Answer (In my case)
    * When I was young, I thought the price of present was not important and effort was more precious. But, nowadays, pricey present is better than others such as hand-made present. Above all, I think the best present is which receiver wants to buy.

    > I think the value of a gift doesn't depent on its price, instead it depends on the the giver's sincerity.

    > when kids make a very simple gift for their parents, parents are usually very touched and thrilled
