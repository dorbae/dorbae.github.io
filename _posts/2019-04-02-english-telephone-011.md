# 전화영어 - Day 011 (20190402)


## Part 3

* Question
    * Is it easy to find well-paid jobs in your country?

* Answer (Correction)
    * No, it isn't. The gap of salary between employees of major companies and small companies is getting wider. However, compared to small companies there much fewer major companies and it is hard to enter them. Aside from that, many companies require too many things to the applicants, so I think it is easy to find well-paid job in my country.

<br />

* Question
    * Do you think robots will replace human worker in the future?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes I think. In fact, many jobs are already being done by robots. For example, in some companies robots do some routine and repetitive work instead of humans, so I think in the future this system will be more prevalent. I think it is because, they make less mistakes and they do complain or argue with what the company wants them to do. So I think in the future companies will prefer to use robots than human workers.

# Part 1

* Question
    * Tell me about your morning routine.

* Answer (Correction)
    * My day usually starts at 7 in the morning. After doing my daily morning routines like making the bed, taking a shower and so on, I feed my pets. Then I eat breakfast and  go to work.

    > give food to my pets -> feed my pets

<br />

* Question
    * Is breakfast important to you? Why or why not?

* Answer
    * I think it is very important to me to eat breakfast in the morning. Because if I didn't eat breakfast, I can't concentrate my work and other thing. Because I'm too hungry.

<br />

 * Question
    * Is is easy to get up early in morning?

 * Answer (Correction)
    * No it isn't. I can't get up early because I usually sleep late at night because I have to study IELTS and do other things so I can't get up early.

# Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a teenager you know
    * You should say: 
        * Who this teenager is
        * How you know this teenager
        * What this teenager likes to do
        * And how you feel about this teenager

* Answer (Correction)
    *  I'd like to talk about the younger brother of my friend who is 17 years old and a high school student. I met him one year ago when I came over my friends home to play with him. He likes to play video games so when I came over my friends home he played with us. To my surprise he was very good at it, in fact, he defeated me and his brother. After then, we sometimes play games together, I think maybe twice month so we become really closer. I think he is a very nice teenager and is fun to be with, however, I am worried about him since he is into playing video games very much and I think he can't concentrate on his studies well.
