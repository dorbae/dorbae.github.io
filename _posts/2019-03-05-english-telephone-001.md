## Part 2
* Question
    * Describe an item you bought but do not often use
    * You should say: 
        * When you bought it
        * Where you bought it
        * Why you bought it
        *• And explain why you didn’t often use it

* Answer
    * Three months ago, I bought a book entitled Blockchain. It is a book that describes the new technology called Blockchain which are linked using cryptography. I bought it from the bookstore near my house and frankly speaking it wasn't very cheap. Nevertheless, I bought it because this new technology is used in my company so I really want to learn about it more intensively because I think it can be useful to me in various section. I am really the type of person who likes to study new things especially if it is related to computer technology. However, I don't often use if because I am usually busy at work, in fact, I usually go home late and exhausted so I don't have the time and energy to read it. In addition, I have also started to prepare for the IELTS, so frankly speaking, within 3 months, I have only read around 20 pages out of 300 or 400 pages. (But in the future, I would really like to read it and learn about Blockchain technology.)

    * Intro (short)
    * First topic sentence + explanation/example
    * Second topic sentence + explnation/example
    * Conclusion 
    * 5- 6 sentences
    * for 2~4minutes

    * 안 쓰는 물건들을 어떻게 처리하니/다루니?

* Answer
    * I think one of the best ways to deal with unused items is to sell them online. Nowadays, there are many websites where people can sell their items they no longer used but are still in good condition. For example, in my case, I sell my books, clothes and even electronic items. In this way, I can dispose the items I no longer need and earn money at the same time.
