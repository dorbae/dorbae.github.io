# 전화영어 - Day 012 (20190404)


## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a teenager you know
    * You should say: 
        * Who this teenager is
        * How you know this teenager
        * What this teenager likes to do
        * And how you feel about this teenager

* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to talk about the younger brother of my friend who is 17 years old and a high school student. I met him one year ago when I came over my friends home to play with him. He likes to play video games so when I came over my friends home he played with us. To my surprise he was very good at it, in fact, he defeated me and his brother. After then, we sometimes play games together, I think maybe twice month so we become really closer. I think he is a very nice teenager and is fun to be with, however, I am worried about him since he is into playing video games very much and I think he can't concentrate on his studies well so I worry about his future. But I think if he plays games really well it will be his advantage because nowadays there are many jobs that require this kind of skill such as programmer, game developer and so on. According to him he wants to be a professional gamer and I support his dream.

## Part 3

* Question
    * 너희 나라에서는 10대가 노인들을 어떻게 대하는가?

* Answer (Correction)
    * In my country, most teenagers consider the elderly people. For instance, they help them carry their heavy baggage when going down or up the stairs, some also concede there seats in the bus or subway. But sometimes, some teenagers afflict elderly people. For instance, a few days ago, a group of teenagers hit an old man for no reason so the poor old man had to go the hospital because he was badly hurt.

<br />

* Question
    * What's the difference between teenagers and old people?

* Answer (Correction)
    * There are many differences between teenagers and old people. First, it their physical strength. Teenagers are of course more active than them  so they prefer outdoor activities while the elderly like to stay indoor. Secondly, older people have a lot of experiences compared to the younger ones so they usually know the solutions to some things teenagers cannot solve. Finally they also have differe goals in life. Teenagers goal is to be admitted to a university while the old people are more worried about their family's future.

<br />

* Question
    * Do you think teenagers today are better than those teenagers 30 years ago?

* Answer (Correction)
    * No, I don't think so. I think the teenagers 30 years ago were more hard-working, determined and even patriotic. This is because back then, Korea suffered a lot of econmic difficulty but they worked not only for themselves but also for their families. They also fought for the country when the country was under a dictator. However, modern teenagers, are more impatient and not as conscientious as those 30 years ago because they depend on their parents who give them everything they want. Moreover, they also do not care about national issues, instead they only think of themselves.
