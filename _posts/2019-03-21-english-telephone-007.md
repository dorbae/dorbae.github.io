# 전화영어 - Day 007 (20190321)


## Homework
* Question
    * What are the routine activities that old people and young people do in your country?
* Answer (Prepared)
    * Young people in my country usually go to school for studying. However, unfortunately, they should go to academy not only after  shcool, but also on weekend. Because, in Korea, many people think it is the most important thing in whole life to go to university. It is so sad that students should study again and again.
    On the other hand, older people **go to anywhere** they want to go anywhere by subway. They usually take a subway. Because older people who are above 65 years old can take it for free. And then, they used to communicate and watch TV with other older peole or play a Chess so on in the park or accommodation for them.

    > go to anywhere(x) -> go anywhere(o)

## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a success your friend has achieved
    * You should say:
        * Who your friend is
        * What the success was
        * What he or she did
        * How you felt about the success

* Answer 
    * **I would like to talk about** my university friend who is now an owner of a company which has more than 30 employees. Actually, that company was used to be managed by his father, but his father allowed him to operate instead when he got older. So far, he has been managing the company for 2 years and since he took over, the company's profit has increased as well as the number of employees.  Whenever I see him, I am inspired to work harder and get motivated to come up with/formulate new ideas for my own career to flourish. Furthermore, he also has a daughter, which I think is also another great achievement of him and I also want to have a baby. I think someday, I will be successful like him, I just need to work harder to have start my own company.

> take over : 인수하다

> flourish : 번창하다

## Part 3

* Question
    * What kinds of people are considered successful in your society?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Rich people and university professors are usually considered successful in my country. As for rich people, it is a well-known fact that for many people money is the basis of success that's why we think rich people have already achieved a lot.
    In the case of university professors, people admire them and they usually have good reputation. It is because it is not easy to be a professor in my country. They have to go through a lot but only a few of them make it. So once, someone becomes a professor people respect them because they know they must really intellegent.
