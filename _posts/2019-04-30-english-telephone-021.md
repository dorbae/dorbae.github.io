# 전화영어 - Day 021 (20190430)

## Part 1 (Puctuality)

* Question
    * Is punctuality being on time important?

* Answer (In my case)
    * Yes, I think it is very important to us. Because when we make appintment, we should keep it. So, if someone didn't keep time, we feel disappointment to **him**.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, I think so. We always have to keep our appointment so we won't disappoint others. So, other's won't lose their trust on us.

    > puctuality : being on time (시간엄수))

    > 특정 사람을 지명하는게 아니므로 him -> others

<br />

* Question
    * What do you do when you arrive early?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I usually arrive at early. When that, I usually go on cafe or walk around place such as grocerry or market and so on.

* Answer (Correction)
    * When I arrive early, I usually walk around the nearby shops like grocery or bookstore. Sometimes I just stay at the meeting place and read a book or observe other people.

<br />

* Question
    * Is it less important or more important to be on time today than in the past?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think it is more important now. It is because nowdays, time is more important and spending time efficiently is very important to us. Because by technology, we can do more something in short time. I think time is money and many people think so. So, Nowdays, puctuality is more important than in the past.
 
* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, I think so because modern people are always in a hurry, so it is important to be punctual. For most  people, time is money so if you are late for an appointment for someone, you might be wasting their time and opportunity to earn some money.

<br />

* Question
    * How do you feel if someone is late for appointment with you?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I can understand someone who is late when he is late a little bit. If he or she is too late, I feel very upset and I think I lost my time and opportunity to make something. If he would be late again and again, I'll not meet up him.

* Answer (Correction)
    * If a person is late for a little bit, not more than 15 minutes to specific, I could understand and I forgive him or her. However, if it is beyond that and it happened several times, I would probably get upset and won't meet him every again. 

    > not meet up person -> Stop seeing person

    > 15분 같이 구체적인 시간/정도를 넣어주는게 좋음

* Answer (In my case)
    * Back into my university, when I was university student, I received a horrible service on taxi. Long a ago, I drunk with my girfriend who is my wife now and my friends. We drunked a lot of alchohol and my girfriend was drunken. So I had to give away her. But, it was hard to carry her on my back. Because she was so drunken. So, I thought I should got a taxi and I did that. Some taxi came and I asked to go her house where was nearby we are. But, taxi driver rejected my request. The reason he rejected is that destination is too close and he couldn't earn lots of money. So, I argued with him. Finally, we went to police office to solve that problem. I was very upset. Because I wanted to receive a service after paying, but he didn't proper serivce about that. So, I feel very uncomportable about that.

We drank a lot but my girlfriend was especially drunken. I had to take her home but it was hard for me to carry her on my bak because she was so drunken.
