# 전화영어 - Day 026 (20190516)

## Part 3
* Question
    * In your country, do parents give children money for doing house work?

* Answer (In my case)
    * Yes, in my country many parent give money to thier children if they clean their room or clear parents's shoes. Because parents think ?? and motivate why they should do that. So many parents in my country think it is useful to some money to children for doing house work.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, I think so. Parents usually ask their children to do some minor house chores such shining some shoes, sweeping the floor, making their beds and so on then give them some money as a reward for completing their tasks. Parents do this to teach them how to responsible at home and to know the value of money at a young age.

* Question
    * What do you think of saying money is the root of all evil?

* Answer (In my case)
    * Actually, I agree about that. Because the more people want money, the more they can focus on only how to make money. It means that they can fire someone for earning more money and they can do wrong things for earnig more money. For example, in my case my ex-co-worker who violated something in my company and he stolen our technology and then sold it to other company. He earned some money. But, after that, he lost reputation and his co-workers. We sued him until now.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Actually I agree with that saying/statement. I think because of money people change and do some unimaginable things. For instance, my former co-worker stole our technology, moved to another company and sold it to them all because of money. However, he lost his friends and coworkers' trust and respect. Aside from that, our company also sued him. So overall, he lost some people as well as his reputation just because he wanted more money.

    > reputation : /re - pyu - tey - tion/

    > sue : 고소하다

* Question
    * What kinds of occasions require people to send money as gifts?
 
* Answer (Correction)
    * In my country people usually give cash gifts on someone's wedding day. This is because they want to give the newly-wed couple some money to spend for their honeymoon and to compensate for the money they used to prepare for their wedding. In addition, we also give mone to our parents on Parent's day not only to show our gratitude to them but also because this is the most practical gift since we don't need to be bothered to  shop for some items. Instead, they can just do whatever they want to do with the money.
