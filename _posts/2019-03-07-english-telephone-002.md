## Part 3 (Cont.)
* Question
    * Do people in your country care about waste lassification?

* Answer
    * In my case
        * Many people in our country care about waste classification because when we violate legal about waste classification we have to pay a fine. So they always do well waste classification. In Korea there are some legal that should threw waste on decide days. Usually, I classify waste to plastic and cans and paper. we throw them to separated thrash. if i want throwing out furniture I must pay for waste fee. I have a seprate thrash i my home because when I throw a thrash in my home I can separate them easily.

        * Many people in our country care about waste classification because when we violate the law related to proper waste management we have to pay a fine. In Korea, we should throw waste on designated days according to the law. We also segregate our garbage according to its kind, for example we put together recylable trash like plastic, cans and paper. If we want to throw away some furniture we must pay for waste fee. In my case, I also do the same thing too.

    > legal -> law
    > classify ~~ seperate ~~ segregate

* Question
    * Do people in your country care about the pollution caused by packaging?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, we do. For instance, in my country, in the past when we go buy something in a store, we can take them using a disposable plastic bags for free but now if they want to use them they have to otherwise they have to use their own shopping bags. In addition, cafeterias in Korea are required to serve their customers their coffee or tea in reuseable cups or mugs. If they use plastic cups they will be fined.
