# 전화영어 - Day 013 (20190409)


## Part 1

* Question
    * When was the last time you were at a park or a garden?

* Answer
    * Last time when I was at a park was 2 weeks ago. I went to a park where located next to river and near by my house. I went to there with my wife and pets.

<br />

* Answer
    * Yes. There are many public parks in my country. For instance, many parks were in main river in my local. And there are some parks in apartment area. A lot of people go there to take a rest.

> go to there -> go there

<br />

* Question
    * What do you think are the benefits of having gardens or parks in the city. 

* Answer (My case)
    * I think there several advantage of that. At first, people can take a rest in the park feeling fresh air and seeing landscape. The other reason is that. There are too many cars and people in my city. But, in a park, people can feel comportable and they can take a walk with their pets.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think there are several advantages. **First**, since people who live in the city are usually busy, parks provide them a place where they can take a rest and feel the fresh air. Parks can also be a place for them to bond with their family or walk their pets.

> At first -> first

> At first == in the beginning

## Part 2

* Question
    * 
* Question
    * Describe a teenager you know
    * You should say: 
        * Who this teenager is
        * How you know this teenager
        * What this teenager likes to do
        * And how you feel about this teenager

* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to talk about the younger brother of my friend who is 17 years old and a high school student. I met him one year ago when I came over my friends home to play with him. He likes to play video games so when I came over my friends home he played with us. To my surprise he was very good at it, in fact, he defeated me and his brother. After then, we sometimes play games together, I think maybe twice month so we become really closer. I think he is a very nice teenager and is fun to be with, however, I am worried about him since he is into playing video games very much and I think he can't concentrate on his studies well so I worry about his future. But I think if he plays games really well it will be his advantage because nowadays there are many jobs that require this kind of skill such as programmer, game developer and so on. According to him he wants to be a professional gamer and I support his dream.

    * You should say: 
        * When it happened
        * Who you complained to
        * What you complained about
        * And why you were satisfied with the result
       
* Answer (Correction)
    * I went to a Korean restaurant last year with my friend. However, when we got there, I noticed the table where we were supposed to dine was so dirty. I informed the waiter/server/crew about it, but he ignore us and was a little bit rude. So I looked for the manager and complained about our uncleaned table as well as the attitude of the crew. The manager was apologetic when he heard about complaints he asked one of the staff to clean the table immediately and surprisingly, the staff became more polite. So I was very satisfied with the result because they acted quickly. Furthermore, they also gave us some **food on the house** as a compensation for the inconvenience they caused us.

> noticed /no-tist/ 발음 주의

> the last year -> last year

> food on the house == for free

* Answer (My case)
    * I think a lot of people in my country usually complain about the quality of food or electronic products. For example, some people complain taste of food. Because it is so hot or salty. And some people complain the electronic product. Because it is so expensive.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think a lot of people in my country usually complain the quality of the food they are served. Most of them complain about its tastes being so spicy, salty and even bland. In addition, I think many people also have negative feedback with some electronic gadgets. They think that some of them are too expensive or not durable enough.
