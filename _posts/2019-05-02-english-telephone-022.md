# 전화영어 - Day 022 (20190502)

## Part 2
* Question
    * Describe a time you received horrible service
    * You should say: 
        * When it happened
        * Where you received
        * Who you were with
        * What happened
        * And why the service was horrible

* Answer (In my case)
    * Back into my university, when I was university student, I received a horrible service on taxi. Long a ago, I drunk with my girfriend who is my wife now and my friends. We drunked a lot of alchohol and my girfriend was drunken. So I had to give away her. But, it was hard to carry her on my back. Because she was so drunken. So, I thought I should got a taxi and I did that. Some taxi came and I asked to go her house where was nearby we are. But, taxi driver rejected my request. The reason he rejected is that destination is too close and he couldn't earn lots of money. So, I argued with him. Finally, we went to police office to solve that problem. I was very upset. Because I wanted to receive a service after paying, but he didn't proper serivce about that. So, I feel very uncomportable about that.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Back when I still a university student, I experienced a horrible taxi service. It happened when, I drunk with my friends and my girlfriend who is now my wife. We overdid it so my so we were all drunken, particularly my girlfriend. I had to take her homw, but it was hard to carry her on my back because she couldn't control herself anymore. So, I decided to get a taxi instead. We waited for a while then when a taxi passed by, I stopped and asked the driver to take us to my girlfriend's house which was near where we were. But the taxi drived rejected/denied my request. According to him, our destination was too close and he couldn't earn much from us. So I argued with him and reminded him that it was illegal to reject customers and that it was their duty to take passengers to their destination. Finally, we went to the police station to solve the problem. I was very upset because I was willing to pay just to get his service but he couldn't provide it to use. So, thinking about it now, I still consider it as the most horrible service I have ever received.

## Part 3
* Question
    * What kinds of service is bad service?

* Answer (In my case)
    * It is very interesting question. I think it is bad service for server to give somthing not friendly. It makes customers uncomfortable. So it is bad service.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think any kind of service that makes customers uncomfortable is a bad service. This is because, part of giving customer service is to welcome them and give them the most convenient service they could get. I think slow service is also considered bad especially in Korea where people are always in a hurry. 

<br />

* Question
    * Why do some people choose to remain silent when they receive bad services?

* Answer (In my case)
    * It is because that some people do not want make argument. Some people are so shy. So, they feel uncomfortable for saying their opnion about bad service. In face, I also sometimes remain silent about experiece bad service. I feel little bit tiresome about that.

    > 3. They are naturally understanding/considerate and kind

<br />

* Question
    * Who should be responsible for bad services?
    
* Answer (In my case)
    * I think server and store or restaurant where I got the serivice have responsible for bad services. They should give proper service because they receieve money for their service. And when we pay for the service, It contains fee of server's service. So they should give good service.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think the staff/crew should be blamed for the bad services for several reasons. First, it is their responsibility to give proper service to the customers since they are paid to do it. Second, I think that before starting their job, they have been trained and taught about proper customer service, but if they fail to do that, it is all their fault.

<br />

* Question
    * If you were the boss, what did you do to prevent bad services?

* Answer (In my case)
    * If I was a boss, I would like to train them more and emphasize their attitude for customers. And when customer have complain for some my step, I warn about that for 3 times. After that, cut their salary. And when customer praise step's attitude, I give them bonus.

* Answer (Correction)
    * If I were a boss, I would train all my staff and orient them on how to provide excellent customer service. In addition, if perform well, I would give them some monetary incentive as well as fringe benefits. However, if they fail to deliver an excellent service I would give them some punishment such as salary deduction.
