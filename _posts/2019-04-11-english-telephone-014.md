## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a person you have seen who is beautiful or handsome
    * You should say: 
        * Where you saw this person
        * When you saw this person
        * What the person looked like
        * Why you think this person is handsome or beautiful

* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to talk about my university friend who I met when we were both freshman. When I met him in the university's welcome party for new students, I saw him there and later I learned that we were in the same class. I wanted to be friends with him because he looked nice however, he was somewhat taciturn. Nevertheless, I though he was very good-lookig. He had bushy eyebrows and his eyes were much bigger compared to other guys and they were very expressive too.  He's very tall, in fact I think he's more than 185cm tall. He has great muscles so he looked like a movie star. But when I got to know him more eventually, I realized that he is handsome not only because of his great appearance but also smart. In fact, when we graduated from the university, he studied for another 6 months then got admitted to another university which many people thought was so much better than our previous univesity.
