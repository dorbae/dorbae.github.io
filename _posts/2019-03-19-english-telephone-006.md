    * Teacher
        * I think it is very fascinating. When I was young, my friend took care of ``an`` iguana. At first, I thought it ``was`` disgusting but later, I realized that taking care of iguana has a lot of advantages than disadvantages. So I think, having  exotic animals as pets is a good idea.

> exotic : == not common

## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe something you do to help you study or work
    * You should say: 
        * What it is
        * How you learn it
        * When you do it
        * And how you feel about the method

* Answer (Correction)
    * Listening to music helps me study or work harder. I used to study in the library, however, I wasn't about to concentrate probably because  so much silence make me feel sleep or think of something else. So I tried studying in the cafeteria where I could entered different types of noise. To block them, I tried to put on my earphone and listen to music while studying. Surprisingly, it worked, so I realized that it is more effective than studying in the library. So whenever I should prepare for some important examinations or when I am developing some computer programs, I use this method to make me more concentrated. Other people might find it weird but to me this is very helpful and I think it has some scientific explanation. For others, this might not be a good method, but to me it is so I will keep on doing it.

## Part 3

* Question
    * 어떤 공부 방법이 좋다고 생각하니?

* Answer
    * I think reading a book or any learning materials again and again is one of the most effective methods to learn something. By doing this we can easily remember what we are trying to study. Moreover, reading or memorizing before going to bed can also be an effective method for learning. This is because, those things that we study before sleeping retain in our brain, therefore we can memorize them naturally.

<br />

* Question
    * What are the routine activities that old people and young people do in your country?

* Answer
    * (Homework)
