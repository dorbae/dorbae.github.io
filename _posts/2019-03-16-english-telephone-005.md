## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a language you want to learn (not English)
    * You should say: 
        * What it is
        * How you would learn it
        * Where you would learn it
        * And why you want to learn the language

* Answer (Correction)
    * I want to try to learn Japanese, as a matter of fact, I have been considering/contemplating about it for four years now. Actually, my uncle is in Japan so I want to learn from him, however, it would be difficult because of our distance and we are also both busy with our respective jobs, so I think it would be best for me to learn it from a Japanese academy. The reason why I want to learn Japanese is that some of my businesses is relate with Japanese. I have been to Japan 4 times for business and it has always been difficult for me to communicate with other Japanese engineers. So, I have been thinking that learning Japanese would make the situation easier. Furthermore, my business partner, who is also a Japanese guy, challenged me to learn his language and he even told me that he would give me some prize if I do, so I want to accept that challenge.

## Part 3
* Question
    * 다른 나라의 언어를 배우기 위한 효율적인 방법은 무엇인가?

* Answer
    * I think one of the most effective ways is to go the country where the language is being spoken. I think it is very helpful to the learner if he can hear the language everyday and even use it naturally which he can only do if he visits that country. 
    And another way is making foreign friends. ~~
