* Answer (In my case)
    * Back in my high school, I loved to play video game which named Winnin eleven and was soccer game. So, I used to go to video game room with my friends to play that game. And I borrowed video game console from my friend. Because he had it, but he didn't play the game in his house. So, I asked him to borrow it. I trained my gaming skill in my home playing that game. Because I was not good at the game. So, I wanted to be more good game player. So, I borrowed it from my friend.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I borrowed video game console from my friend because he had video gamee console but he didnt play the game in his house so I asked him to borrow it and I train my gaming skill at my home playing tha game because I was not good at the game so I wanted to be a good player so I borrowd it from my friend. Luckily he lent it to me without any hesitations/with a second thought and used it to train my gaming skill at home. I think his game console was with me for approximately one month. I needed to borrow it because I really wanted to be a good gamer just like the other kids in the game room. However, after a month, I returned it to him because I lost interst in the playing video games, nevertheless I was thankful to my friend.

## Part 3
* Question
    * Why do some people like to borrow things intead of buy them?

* Answer (In my case)
    * Because they can reduce the risk. Because if they buy something new, they may not satisfied with it. So, they borrow it at first, and they can know how it is good at them. And if it is good at them, they can buy it. Sometimes some stuff is too expensive to buy it. They sometimes borrow it from their friends or co-workers.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Some people choose to borrow something to avoid risk of wasting money. By borrowing, they can have an idea whether the item works well. In addition, some people have no choice but to borrow something from others because they still do not have enough money to buy for themselves. If they know that they will only use it once, ~~~

<br />

* Question
    * What would you do if people do not return money you borrowed?

* Answer (Correction)
    * It depends on the kind of relationship I have with someone. If the person is really my close friend, I will just remind him again and again about it. However, if we aren't very close, I would probably file a legal complaint against him.
