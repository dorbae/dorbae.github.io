And I was able to have change to go to museum of Louvre. And then I saw 4 paintings which had the face of men which represented the weather. One of them represented Spring and it was composed of fruit and vegetable which grew up in Spring. It was very fresh painting and I deeply moved by the painter's idea. I saw many works of art in the museum.
    
* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to talk about some impressivev work of art. When I was young, I went to Paris and stayed there for over a month because my father was studying there. Because of that, I was able to have a chance to go to the Louvre Museum where I saw a set of paintings which had faces of men representing the four seasons, thus it is called The Four Seasons. Since it depicted the four seasons, each painting had the elements of each season. For instance, the painting about spring had some vegetables and fruits that made up the man's face while the winner shows the face of a man with a tree consisting of few leaves. It was something new to me so I was really impressed. I think the idea was unique but excellent so it kind of moved me compared to the paintings in that museum.
