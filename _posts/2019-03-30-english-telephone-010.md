# 전화영어 - Day 010 (20190330)


## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe your grandparent’s job
    * You should say: 
        * What it was
        * How long he or she had this job
        * How he or she got the job
        * And whether you would like to have this job

* Answer (Correction)
    * I would like to talk about my maternal grandfather. He was a professor in a university in Korea and even in China. To be specific, he taught Korean literature and he has been in one university for 25 years. I actually lived with him when I was younger so I heard so many stories from him. According to him, he was a teacher in high scholl first where he taught English to his students. Then he studied the Korean novel called/entitled ----- deeply and he got a university degree. I think his job was a great job because teaching others is very rewarding especially when you make some disciples. For instance, when he passed away, many of his former students attended his funeral. However, I can't imagine myself doing my grandfather's job because I think it is very hard to share my knowledge to others and make them understand it. Instead, I can just teach technology to my co-workers.

    > my grandfather from mother's side = my maternal grandfather

    > my grandfather from father's side = my paternal grandfather

## Part 3

* Question
    * What kinds of jobs are difficult to do?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think being a CEO is very difficult because it requires handling many people and making sure the company makes some profit. A CEO should always meet many people to entertain and satisfy them. However, the main reason why I think it is hard to be a CEO is because he has to think of some plans and strategy to enhance the company. Because of he has to think about a lot of things even those factors that he doesn't know.

* Answer (Better)
    *  I think jobs that are pysically demanding is very difficult because not only is exhausting but could also be dangerous. Some examples of this job are construction workers, miners and so on.

    * I think jobs that require you use your imagination and come with unique ideas (writer)

    * I think jobs inwhich the lives of other people depend on you (doctors, bus drivers)
