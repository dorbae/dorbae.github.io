# 전화영어 - Day 019 (20190425)

## Part 1

* Question
    * Do you like short holiday or long holiday?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I prefer to take a long holiday. It is because in long holiday, I can go **to** abroad and take a **break more time**. So, if I have a chance to have long holiday, I want to go to Europe. 

* Answer (Correction)
    * I prefer to take a long holiday. It is because in long holiday, I can go abroad and take a longer break. So, if I have a chance to have long holiday, I want to go to Europe.

    > go to abroad -> go abroad

    > 형용사이므로 전치사 필요 없음. 명사일 경우 전치가 붙일 것

    > take a break more time -> take a longer break

<br />

* Question
    * Who do you like to go on holiday with?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I want to go holiday with my wife. Because, when we take a holiday, my wife usually take a plan. So I just take a trip without planning. Because always she make a plan.

* Answer (Correction)
    * It would be none other than my wife. Of course, I always want to be with her and also, she is a very organized/calculative person, so when I travel with her, I don't have to worry about our itinerary because she plans everything.

## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a family business you know
    * You should say: 
        * What the business is
        * How you know it
        * What products it sells
        * Who the customers are
        * And how you like it

* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to talk about a restaurant own by the Kim family. I heard that this restaurant was originally owned by the family's grandparents and was passed on from generation to generation. It sells Korean traditional food and I first learned about this place when I saw it on a tv show that features restaurants. It showed the restaurant was crowded with people who said that the food there was very delicious and the customer service was excellent. So I got very curious about this restaurant so I searched the internet for it and to my surprise, I found out that it was just close to where I lived. So I asked my friends to go there with me and when we got there, there were a lot of people from all walks of life. As expected, the restaurant really served some appetizing local cuisines and the staff were all welcoming and attentive. Actually, the food they served were simple Korean food, but it has some special taste probably because of their best-kep secret family recipe. 


    > some + count noun/s = some restaurants 

    > some + non count noun (no -s)

## Part 3

* Queestion
    * What is advantage and disadvantage of family business?

* Answer (No correction)
    * I think there are a lot of advantage and disadvantage of it. First, advantage of it is that they can work efficiently, becuase they are close than other people and they know each other well. So it can be very helpful in business. However, it has disadvantage also. I think family business usually not give a change to operate the business to other people. Because they are not family. It can loose a change to expand their business.

    > walk /wok/

    > work /werk/
