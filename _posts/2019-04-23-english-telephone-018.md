    * I'd like to know this person who goes by the nickname Sergio, who is a Russian software engineer currently based in New York. I first knew about him a few years ago when I searched for some free software on the internet which I needed to manage database. I found a great one which is free but has a lot of functions so I have been using it since then. I was very impressed with it so I searched a little about its  creator but I could only find little information about him so I would like to know him more if I would have a chance. To be specific, I would like to know more about his career like how it started and his motivations. I am also cuirious about how he developed his skills and what he is currently working on. I think if I could meet him in real life, I can learn many things from him and communicating with him can lead me to enhance my skills.
