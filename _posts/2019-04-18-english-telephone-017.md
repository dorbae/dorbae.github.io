# 전화영어 - Day 017 (20190418)


## Part 1

* Question
    * Do you prefer to work in the ealry morning or at night?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I am actually a night person/a night owl so I prefer doing/working at night because in the morning there are a lot distractions. So if I do something in the morning I can't concentrate on it.

<br />

* Question
    * Why do some people find it difficult to focus or concentrate at night?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think many people are so tired at night, because of their hard working. They usually cannot concentrate something.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think most people consume so much energy during the day time so at night they already feel exhausted, therefore it is hard for them to keep their focus at night.    

<br />

* Question
    * What do you do to improve your efficiency?

* Answer (In my case)
    * I prefer to do something I should concentrate in the cafeterria. And hearing music by my headphone, I usually do that. It is because white noise makes me more focused.

* Answer (Correction)
    * For better efficiency I usually go to a cafe if I have to do something really important and listen to music while doing it. I think white noise/I think having a background music helps me stay focused.

        * Why you would like to know this person more

    > 처음에 잘못 이해함. **haven't seen**

* Answer (In my case)
    * Before a few years ago, I needed some software to manage database. So I searched some good free software in the Internet. Finally, I found great one which was free and had a lot of functions. So, since then I have used it. And I knew that he made it. So, I want to know about his career and developing skills and where he is working on. It is because if I meet him in real life, I can learn many things from him. Communicating with him can lead me to enhance my skill for developing. I want to meet him somedays.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I'd like to know this person who goes by the nickname Sergio, who is a Russian software engineer currently based in New York. I first knew about him a few years ago when I searched for some free software on the internet which I needed to manage database. I found a great one which is free but has a lot of functions so I have been using it since then. I was very impressed with it so I searched a little about its  creator but I could only find little information about him so I would like to know him more if I would have a chance. To be specific, I would like to know more about his career like how it started and his motivations. I am also cuirious about how he developed his skills and what he is currently working on. I think if I could meet him in real life, I can learn many things from him and communicating with him can lead me to enhance my skills.

## Part 3

* Question
    * Is it important for children to have friends?

* Answer (In my case)

    * Yes, I think it is important that children have friends. The reason is that when children meet their friends, they can learn about other person's thinking and friednship with them. It can make them to be more sociable people. And socialable persone is more attractive than unsocialable people. ...

    > 주제에 벗어나게 sociable에 대한 내용만 얘기함.

* Answer (Correction)
    * Yes, I think is essential especially for modern children who are usually an only child or spend a lot of time with their electronic gadgets. Having friends will give them an opportunity get away from their sedentary lifestyle and make their health much better. Of course, it is also helpful for their social development. By having friends they can learn how to deal with people and learn about the value of sharing and cooperation so they will grow up as compassionate people.

<br />

* Question
    * Which is better having many friends or just few close one.

* Answer (In my case)
    * I think it is more important to have real friends even though a few. It is because when I have bad situation, only the real friends sincely concern about that. Having many friends is good for me usually. But most of them are not friends who really concern about me. So, I think even thouh there are a few friends, having real friends is good for me.

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think having many people around me is a good thing, however, I think not all of them will be there for me in bad times. I think only those few and true friends will be there for me both in good times and in bad times
