* Question

## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a subject you used to dislike but now have interest in
    * You should say: 
        * *What the subject is
        * Why you disliked it
        * What you are interested in now
        * And explain why you become interested in

* Answer (Correction)
    * The subject I am interested in now but I disliked when I was young is science. First, because it was too hard for me since I have to study several branches of science before moving to another since they are related to each other. For intance, before studying physics, I had to study biology and chemistry first. To make matters worst, my high school teacher in science was serious and didn't have a sense of humor so I often fell asleep in her class. However, last year, I accidentally watched a Youtube video about astronomy and I realized it wasn't difficult to learn. Since then I have become interested in science and watched other videos related to some famous scientists and theorise. Moreover, physica is also being used in my work especially when I need to develop some new programs. So now, I don't dislike science anymore, instead I find it interesting and useful.

    > subject : 과목. ex) math, science, english

    > interest (noun) vs interesting (adj)
    
    > have interest in : 관심있다의 옳은 표현

    > be interesting : 잘난척 하는 표현
