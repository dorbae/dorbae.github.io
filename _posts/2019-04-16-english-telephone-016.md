# 전화영어 - Day 016 (20190416)


## Part 2

* Question
    * Describe a time that someone didn’t tell you the whole truth about something
    * You should say: 
        * When this happened
        * What the situation was
        * Who you were with
        * And why the person didn’t tell the whole truth

* Answer (Correction)
    * When I was young, my family had a pet dog which was very small. But despite his size, he was in fact, older than I was. However, when I was 7 years old and our dog was 13, he suddenly disappeaed. I looked for high and low for him but I wasn't able to find him. So I was very worried about our dog especially his health, safety and everything about him. It even crossed my mind that maybe he had already passed away, however, my grandfather consoled me by telling me that our dog went away to find his family. After 10 long years, when I had a new pet, my father finally revealed what happened to our first pet dog. According to him he died but they couldn't tell me the truth because since our pet had gone, I only ate a little and they were worried that my condition would get worse. So even though my grandfather lied to me, I totally understand why he did that. He just wanted to protect me from becoming very sad.

## Part 3

* Question
    * Why do peope lie sometimes?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Some people like to be able to deceive others. This is usually true when someone wants to get something from someone in an illegal way. On the other hand, there are some people who lie to protect others' feelings. For instance, when a friend had a new haircut and ask us about it, we definitely would say he/she looks good on it, to avoid hurting him/her.

* Answer (Another Suggestion)
    * Some people lie because they don't want to be blamed or take accountability for some mistakes they have done.

> deceive : 속이다

> chronic liars : 허언병자들(?)

<br />

* Question
    * Some people say that liars have good memory. What do you think?

* Answer (Correction)
    * Although I am aware that lying is a bad thing, I have to agree that liars do have a good memory. This is because to lie, they have to fabricate a story and this story has to be consistent. Which means they have remember every single detail of the story otherwise, people will have a clue that they are lying.
