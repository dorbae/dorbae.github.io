* Question
    * Describe something given to you that you really need
    * You should say: 
        * What it is
        * Who gave it to you
        * Why you need it
        * And how you felt about it

* Answer
    * In my case
        * I was given a new laptop from my wife last year. It is new macbook. I developed applications in work and I want to develop IOS apps and for developing new apps I needed to macbook using another operating system, but it was too expensive to buy it. I got married last year and my wife presented it to me. I was so pleasure to get it, now I use it very well and I made a lot of new apps by it.

    * Teacher
        * I was given a new laptop by my wife last year. It was a new macbook with 15 inches display size. It was also released in 2017 and of course, it has a very sleek design. As I mentioned it was given to me by my wife and it was actually her present to me after our wedding last year. (To be specific I received it from her when were in New York for our honeymoon.) I really needed a new laptop because I have always wanted to develop IOS applications and to do that, I needed a macbook and its operating system. But it was too expensive for me so I couldn't afford it, so I was ecstatic when I received it from my wife. I was also grateful to her because now, I was able to make a lot of new apps using her gift.
    
    > I received from someone or I was given by someone

    > I am so pleasure (X) -> I am so pleased (O)
    
    > pleasure is noun. pelased is adjective.
    
    > I am so pleased 는 너무 쉬운 표현

    > very happy : I'm so thrilled, I'm so ecstatic

    > very happy : I was on cloud nine, I was on top of the world

## Part 3

* Question
    * 너희 나라의 젊은 사람들은 어떤 것을 사고 싶어하는가?

* Answer
    * (기억 안남)
    
<br />

* Question
    * 사람들은 왜 필요 없는 것을 사는가?

* Answer
    * I think it is because people tend to be easily tempted and persuaded to buy something when they hear some good things about it. some people tend to be impulsive buyers. Others want to show off their financial capability

<br />

* Question  
    * What should parents do when their children ask for things their friends have?

* Answer (Correction)
    * I think parents should ask the reason why they want to have something that their friends have because I think it is not good for parents to buy anything that they children want. I think this might turn their children into spoiled brats. Therefore parents should ask for valid reasons before giving in to their children

    > give in - to finally agree/say yes

<br />

## Correction Others

* Who did you go there with?
