    * Getting older, I wanted to write a book which contains my life style and my life story. When I was young, my grandfather wrote his story. He wrote when he was young and how he can be a professor and how he got married and very personal story. I read his book and I thought someday I'm going to write my story, too. It is difficult to write a book can make other people's sympathy. But, I just want to write why I think that for something or why I choose my job. And how I got married and when I met my wife first and how I learned english. The reason I want to write this book is that when I passed away, remained my familly or grandson or granddauther can remember me by reading my book. And other people who have known me can remember me also. So someday, I want to write my story.

* Answer (Correction)
    * As I get older, my interest in writing a book becomes stronger so in the future I want to write an autobiography. It would contain my lifestory including my failures, achivements and milestones. Actually, I got this idea from my grandfather who wrote an autobiography when I was young. He said we wrong about his childhood and how he became a professor. He also write some very personal details including his lovelife. I read this book and I thought someday I am going to write my story too. It is difficult to get others' sympathy but I just want to write my principles, why chose my job, how I met my wife and how we got married. I would also write about how I learned English. The biggest reason why I want to put my story in a book, is because I want my family including my granchildren to remember me whenever they read my book. I also want others to recognize and be inspired by me. So someday I want to write story.
